# just-a-blog
A simple blog software that doesn't require a database, and separates content from presentation.

## Features
- Respects the user
-- just-a-blog tries to stay out of your way as much as possible.
-- Doesn't force jquery or any other framework on you.
-- Degrades gracefully for screenreaders or text-only environments
-- You can use your preferred tool for editing pages and posts. 
- Compatible
-- just-a-blog only requires PHP5+. No databases are necessary.
-- Can port existing HTML pages and posts directly into just-a-blog with no need to reformat. (Just remember to change the extension to .md)
- Full customization - Since just-a-blog strives to be small and lightweight, editing it should be extremely easy.
